# üß™ **QUOTATION FLOW TESTING GUIDE**

## ‚úÖ **How to Test the Fixed Quotation System**

This guide will help you verify that all the quotation loophole fixes are working correctly.

---

## üéØ **PREREQUISITES**

### **1. Run Database Migration** (IMPORTANT!)
```sql
-- Execute this SQL file in your Supabase SQL Editor:
-- File: migrations/fix_quotation_data_redundancy.sql

-- This will:
-- ‚úÖ Remove redundant service_id and event_id columns
-- ‚úÖ Create helper functions
-- ‚úÖ Add performance indexes
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** If you don't run the migration first, you'll get errors because the code no longer expects `quotation.service_id` and `quotation.event_id` columns.

---

## üìã **TEST SCENARIO 1: Service Provider Upload**

### **Step 1: Login as Service Provider**
1. Go to `Login.html`
2. Login with a service provider account
3. Navigate to service provider dashboard

### **Step 2: Load Job Carts**
1. Click "Upload Quotation" or navigate to quotation upload page
2. **Expected:** Job cart dropdown shows pending job carts
3. **Check console:** Should see logs like:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Found X job carts for service provider
   üîç Loading quotations for service provider: [service_type]
   ```

**‚úÖ PASS IF:**
- Job carts load successfully
- No `job_cart_acceptance` table errors
- Dropdown populated with job cart options

---

### **Step 3: Upload Quotation**
1. Select a job cart from dropdown
2. Fill in:
   - Price (e.g., R 5000)
   - Details (e.g., "Premium catering package")
   - Upload a PDF file
3. Click "Submit Quotation"

**Expected Database Entry:**
```sql
SELECT 
    quotation_id,
    service_provider_id,
    job_cart_id,
    quotation_price,
    quotation_status,  -- Should be "pending" ‚úÖ
    quotation_submission_date
FROM quotation
ORDER BY quotation_submission_date DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**‚úÖ PASS IF:**
- Quotation saves successfully
- `quotation_status` = `"pending"` (NOT "confirmed")
- No `service_id` or `event_id` columns in insert
- File uploaded to storage
- Success message displayed

---

### **Step 4: Verify Notification**
**Check `notification` table:**
```sql
SELECT 
    notification_id,
    client_id,  -- Should have valid UUID ‚úÖ
    notification_type,
    notification_title,
    notification_message,
    created_at
FROM notification
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**‚úÖ PASS IF:**
- Notification created successfully
- `client_id` is a valid UUID (not NULL)
- `notification_message` contains provider name and price

---

## üìã **TEST SCENARIO 2: Customer View Quotations**

### **Step 1: Login as Customer**
1. Go to `Login.html`
2. Login with the client who created the job cart
3. Complete booking flow:
   - Create event
   - Select services
   - Submit to job cart

### **Step 2: Navigate to Quotations**
1. After job cart created, go to `quotation.html`
2. **Expected:** See uploaded quotations

**Check console logs:**
```
üìã Loading quotations with existing localStorage data...
‚úÖ User authenticated via BookingSession
‚úÖ Client ID: [uuid]
üîÑ Fetching quotations from quotation table...
üìä Found quotations (before filtering): X
üìä After service filter: Y out of X
üìä Filtered quotations: Z out of X total
‚úÖ Found Z quotation(s) for service: [service_name]
```

**‚úÖ PASS IF:**
- Quotations display correctly
- Shows quotations with status = "pending"
- Displays provider name, rating, price
- Shows quotation details
- "Select This Quote" button visible

---

### **Step 3: Select Quotation**
1. Click "Select This Quote" on a quotation card
2. **Expected:** Card highlighted, others disabled
3. Check localStorage:
   ```javascript
   console.log(localStorage.getItem('selectedQuotations'));
   // Should show: {"service_id": "quotation_id"}
   ```

**‚úÖ PASS IF:**
- Quotation card highlights (visual feedback)
- Other cards in same service disabled
- Price breakdown appears
- "Continue to Summary" button enabled

---

### **Step 4: Continue to Summary**
1. Click "Continue to Summary"
2. **Expected:** Redirect to `summary.html`
3. Check localStorage:
   ```javascript
   console.log(localStorage.getItem('selectedQuotationData'));
   // Should show array with complete quotation details
   ```

**‚úÖ PASS IF:**
- Redirects to summary page
- Data stored in localStorage
- No console errors

---

## üìã **TEST SCENARIO 3: Database Verification**

### **Verify Data Structure:**
```sql
-- 1. Check quotation table structure
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'quotation';

-- ‚úÖ PASS IF: NO service_id or event_id columns

-- 2. Check quotation with relationships
SELECT 
    q.quotation_id,
    q.quotation_status,
    q.quotation_price,
    jc.service_id AS service_id_via_job_cart,
    jc.event_id AS event_id_via_job_cart,
    s.service_name,
    e.event_type
FROM quotation q
JOIN job_cart jc ON q.job_cart_id = jc.job_cart_id
LEFT JOIN service s ON jc.service_id = s.service_id
LEFT JOIN event e ON jc.event_id = e.event_id
WHERE q.quotation_status = 'pending'
ORDER BY q.quotation_submission_date DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- ‚úÖ PASS IF: All relationships work, data consistent

-- 3. Test helper functions
SELECT get_quotation_service_id('[quotation_id]');
SELECT get_quotation_event_id('[quotation_id]');

-- ‚úÖ PASS IF: Functions return correct UUIDs
```

---

## üìã **TEST SCENARIO 4: Complete End-to-End Flow**

### **Step 1: Service Provider Uploads**
1. Login as service provider
2. Navigate to quotation upload
3. Select job cart
4. Fill details and upload quotation
5. **Check:** Status = "pending"

### **Step 2: Customer Views**
1. Login as customer (who created the job cart)
2. Navigate to quotations page
3. **Check:** Quotation appears in list
4. **Check:** Details match what SP uploaded

### **Step 3: Customer Selects**
1. Click "Select This Quote"
2. **Check:** Visual feedback
3. **Check:** Price breakdown shows
4. Click "Continue to Summary"

### **Step 4: Verify Status Update**
```sql
-- After customer accepts (if implemented):
SELECT quotation_status 
FROM quotation 
WHERE quotation_id = '[selected_quotation_id]';

-- Expected: "accepted" (after customer confirms selection)
```

**‚úÖ COMPLETE FLOW PASS IF:**
- No console errors throughout
- No database errors
- Data consistent across tables
- UI updates correctly
- Notifications work

---

## üö® **COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS**

### **Issue 1: "Column quotation.service_id does not exist"**
**Solution:** Run the database migration script first!
```sql
-- Execute: migrations/fix_quotation_data_redundancy.sql
```

### **Issue 2: No quotations showing for customer**
**Check:**
1. Quotation status in database (should be "pending")
2. Service IDs match between job cart and quotation
3. Console logs for filtering details
4. localStorage for service IDs

**Debug Query:**
```sql
SELECT 
    q.quotation_id,
    q.quotation_status,
    jc.service_id,
    jc.client_id
FROM quotation q
JOIN job_cart jc ON q.job_cart_id = jc.job_cart_id
WHERE jc.client_id = '[client_id]'
AND q.quotation_status = 'pending';
```

### **Issue 3: Notification not created**
**Check:**
1. Console for notification errors
2. `job_cart.client_id` exists and is valid
3. Notification table permissions

**Debug Query:**
```sql
SELECT 
    jc.job_cart_id,
    jc.client_id,
    c.client_name,
    c.client_email
FROM job_cart jc
JOIN client c ON jc.client_id = c.client_id
WHERE jc.job_cart_id = '[job_cart_id]';
```

### **Issue 4: Job carts not loading for SP**
**Check:**
1. Job carts exist with status = "pending"
2. Service provider is logged in correctly
3. Console for query errors

**Debug Query:**
```sql
SELECT 
    job_cart_id,
    job_cart_item,
    job_cart_status,
    service_id,
    client_id
FROM job_cart
WHERE job_cart_status = 'pending'
ORDER BY job_cart_created_date DESC;
```
