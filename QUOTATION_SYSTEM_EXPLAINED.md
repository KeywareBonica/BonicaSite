# 📋 Quotation System - Complete Explanation

## How the Quotation System Works (Real World)

### Step 1: Client Requests Services
1. **Client logs in** to your app
2. **Client creates an event** (e.g., "My Wedding on Feb 15, 2025")
3. **Client adds services to job cart** (e.g., "I need catering, photography, decoration")
   - Sets budget: Min R1000, Max R5000 per service
4. **Job cart items are created** in database
5. **Service providers get notified** (automatically or manually)

### Step 2: Service Providers Submit Quotations
1. **Service provider logs in** to their dashboard
2. **Sees available job requests** from clients
3. **Uploads their quotation** (PDF or enters details):
   - Price: R3500
   - Details: "Full day photography with 2 cameras, edited photos, album"
   - Attachments: Optional PDF quotation
4. **Quotation is saved** to database with status = 'pending'

### Step 3: Client Views Quotations
**THIS IS WHERE TESTING STARTS!**

**How many quotations does the client see?**
- **MULTIPLE quotations per service!**
- Example for a Wedding event:
  ```
  Catering Service:
  ├─ Quotation 1: Sarah's Catering - R2500
  ├─ Quotation 2: Delicious Events - R3200
  └─ Quotation 3: Party Food Co - R2800
  
  Photography Service:
  ├─ Quotation 1: Mike's Photos - R3500
  ├─ Quotation 2: Perfect Shots - R4000
  └─ Quotation 3: Wedding Pics - R3000
  
  Decoration Service:
  ├─ Quotation 1: Emma's Decor - R1500
  └─ Quotation 2: Beautiful Events - R1800
  ```

**Client sees ALL pending quotations for THEIR event**

### Step 4: Client Accepts ONE Quotation Per Service
1. Client reviews all quotations
2. **Picks the best one** for each service (best price, best provider, etc.)
3. Clicks "Accept" on chosen quotations
4. Other quotations for that service are rejected/ignored

### Step 5: Payment
1. Client proceeds to payment
2. Uploads proof of payment
3. Admin verifies payment
4. Booking is confirmed

## Real-Time vs Test Data - THE KEY DIFFERENCE

### 🔴 REAL-TIME QUOTATIONS (Production)
**In your real application:**
- Service providers **upload quotations manually**
- They use `sp-quotation.html` to submit their offers
- Each provider fills in:
  - Price
  - Description
  - Upload PDF (optional)
- **This happens in real-time** as providers respond to job requests

### 🔵 TEST QUOTATIONS (What we're creating)
**For testing purposes:**
- We **pre-create quotations in the database** using SQL
- This **simulates** what would happen if providers already submitted quotes
- **Why?** So you don't have to:
  1. Create 10 fake provider accounts
  2. Login as each provider
  3. Manually submit quotations
  4. Switch back to client
  5. Then test

**Test data = Skip the provider submission step, just test the client view/accept flow**

## What Client Sees on quotation.html

When client opens `quotation.html`:

```javascript
// The page fetches ALL quotations for the client's events
SELECT * FROM quotation 
WHERE event_id IN (SELECT event_id FROM event WHERE client_id = ?)
AND quotation_status = 'pending'
```

## Key Points

### ✅ Multiple Quotations Per Service
- Each service (catering, photography, etc.) can have **3-10 quotations**
- From **different service providers**
- Client compares and picks the best

### ✅ Real-Time in Production
- In production, providers upload quotations **as they respond**
- Could take hours/days for providers to submit
- Client sees new quotations appear over time

### ✅ Pre-Created for Testing
- For testing, we **create them all at once** with SQL
- So you can **immediately test** the view/accept flow
- Don't have to wait for fake providers

### ✅ One Acceptance Per Service
- Client can only accept **ONE quotation per service**
- Once accepted, other quotations for that service are rejected
- Then proceeds to payment

---

## What Are You Actually Testing?

When you run the test:

1. **Can quotation.html display all quotations?** ✅
2. **Are they grouped by service correctly?** ✅
3. **Can client compare prices/details?** ✅
4. **Does the Accept button work?** ✅
5. **Does status update to 'accepted'?** ✅
6. **Are other quotations rejected automatically?** ✅
7. **Can client proceed to payment?** ✅
8. **Does payment upload work?** ✅

You're **NOT testing**:
- ❌ Service provider quotation upload (that's sp-quotation.html)
- ❌ Real-time notifications
- ❌ PDF generation (unless you want to)

---

## Summary

**Client sees:** ALL quotations from ALL providers for THEIR events
**Client accepts:** ONE quotation per service (best price/quality)
**Real-time:** Providers upload quotations using sp-quotation.html
**Testing:** We pre-create quotations with SQL to skip provider uploads
