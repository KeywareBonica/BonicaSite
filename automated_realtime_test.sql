üß™ AUTOMATED REAL-TIME TEST COMPLETE!

üìã What Just Happened:
1. ‚úÖ Created a fresh job cart for testing
2. ‚úÖ Simulated 3 providers uploading quotations with delays
3. ‚úÖ Tested client acceptance (1 confirmed, 2 rejected)
4. ‚úÖ Verified database status changes

üéØ Now Test Your UI:
1. Login as the client email shown above
2. Go to quotation.html
3. Look for job cart with "Real-Time Test" in the name
4. You should see 3 quotations (1 confirmed, 2 rejected)
5. Test the UI interaction with this real data

üìä Expected Results:
- Client should see the confirmed quotation prominently
- Rejected quotations should be disabled/grayed out
- Price breakdown should show the confirmed quotation price
- "Continue to Payment" should be available

üîç If Issues Found:
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify quotation.html loads the test data
- Test the "Select This Quote" functionality
- Verify payment flow works with confirmed quotation
