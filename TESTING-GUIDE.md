# 🧪 Dual Workflow System Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to test the complete dual workflow system that enables real-time interaction between clients and service providers in the Bonica Event Management System.

## 🎯 What We're Testing

### **The Dual Workflow Process:**
1. **Client Side**: Creates event booking → Selects services → Creates job carts → Waits for quotations → Selects preferred quotations
2. **Service Provider Side**: Gets notified → Accepts job carts → Uploads quotations → Waits for client selection

### **Key Features Being Tested:**
- ✅ Real-time notifications between users
- ✅ Concurrent access control for job cart acceptance
- ✅ Dual user interfaces (client & service provider)
- ✅ Real-time quotation updates
- ✅ Complete workflow from booking to final selection
