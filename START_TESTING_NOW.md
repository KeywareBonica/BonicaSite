# 🧪 START TESTING NOW - Supabase Edition

## STEP 1: Run the SQL Script (2 minutes)

### Go to Supabase:
1. Open your browser
2. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
3. Select your project
4. Click **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
5. Click **+ New query**

### Run the script:
6. Open the file: `use_existing_data_booking_flow.sql`
7. Copy ALL the contents
8. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
9. Click **RUN** (bottom right) or press `Ctrl+Enter`

### What to look for:
- ✅ "Test data created successfully" messages
- ✅ A client email displayed at the end (WRITE THIS DOWN!)
- ✅ Number of job cart items created
- ✅ Number of quotations created

---

## STEP 2: Login and Test (10 minutes)

### Open your application:
1. Go to your app (probably one of your HTML files like `Login.html`)
2. Use the **client email** from Step 1 to login
3. Navigate through the booking flow

### What to test:

#### ✅ Test 1: View Quotations
- Go to quotations page (probably `quotation.html`)
- **Expected**: See quotations for your services
- **Screenshot if broken!**

#### ✅ Test 2: Accept Quotation
- Click "Accept" or similar button on a quotation
- **Expected**: Status changes to "accepted"
- **Screenshot if broken!**

#### ✅ Test 3: Payment Upload
- Go to payment page (probably `payment.html`)
- Upload a test image (any image on your computer)
- Fill in payment details
- Submit
- **Expected**: Success message
- **Screenshot if broken!**

#### ✅ Test 4: View Booking
- Go to bookings page (probably `bookings.html`)
- **Expected**: See your new booking
- **Screenshot if broken!**

---

## STEP 3: Check Database (1 minute)

### In Supabase SQL Editor, run:

```sql
-- See what quotations exist
SELECT 
    q.quotation_id,
    q.quotation_status,
    q.quotation_price,
    sp.service_provider_name,
    s.service_name
FROM quotation q
JOIN service_provider sp ON q.service_provider_id = sp.service_provider_id
JOIN service s ON q.service_id = s.service_id
ORDER BY q.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Expected**: See your test quotations

## 🚨 If Something Breaks

### Common Issues:

**1. "No quotations found"**
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase to check:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM quotation WHERE quotation_status = 'pending';
```
- If 0, the script didn't create quotations
- If > 0, your UI has a bug

**2. "Can't accept quotation"**
- Check browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors
- Check Network tab for API errors
- Share the error with me!

**3. "Payment upload fails"**
- Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage
- Check if "payment-proofs" bucket exists
- Check bucket permissions

---

## 📊 Quick Verification Queries

Run these in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- 1. Check if job carts were created
SELECT COUNT(*) as job_cart_count FROM job_cart;

-- 2. Check if quotations were created
SELECT COUNT(*) as quotation_count FROM quotation;

-- 3. Check latest client (for login)
SELECT client_email, client_name FROM client ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;

-- 4. Check service providers
SELECT COUNT(*) as provider_count FROM service_provider WHERE service_provider_verification = true;
```
