# Cancellation System - Complete Implementation Summary

## âœ… **FIXED ISSUES**

### 1. **Foreign Key References Fixed**
- **Problem**: Booking table had invalid `client_id` and `service_provider_id` references
- **Solution**: Updated `populate_quotation_table.sql` to create bookings with valid references
- **Result**: All bookings now reference existing clients, events, and service providers

### 2. **Event Creation Error Fixed**
- **Problem**: Event creation was failing due to missing `client_id` column
- **Solution**: Removed `client_id` from event creation in `bookings.html`
- **Result**: Event creation now works without database errors

### 3. **Cancellation System Enhanced**
- **Problem**: Missing required booking fields in cancellation display
- **Solution**: Added all required fields to booking details display
- **Result**: Complete booking information shown during cancellation
