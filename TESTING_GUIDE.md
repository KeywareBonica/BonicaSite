# Booking Flow Testing Guide

## Step 1: Run the SQL Script

### Option A: Using Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
3. Create a new query
4. Copy and paste the contents of `use_existing_data_booking_flow.sql`
5. Click **Run** or press `Ctrl+Enter`
6. Review the output to see what test data was created

### Option B: Using PostgreSQL Client
```bash
psql -U your_username -d your_database -f use_existing_data_booking_flow.sql
```

## Step 2: Note Your Test Credentials

After running the script, look for this output:
```
ðŸ”‘ USE THIS TO LOGIN:
email: [some-email@example.com]
name: [Client Name]
```

**Write down this email** - you'll use it to login and test.

## Step 4: Admin Testing (if applicable)

### 4.1 Admin Login

- [ ] **Expected**:
  - [ ] Status updates to "verified" or "approved"
  - [ ] Booking status changes
  - [ ] Client receives notification (if implemented)

## Step 5: Check Database State

Run these queries to verify the data flow:

```sql
-- Check job cart status
SELECT 
    jc.job_cart_id,
    jc.job_cart_item,
    jc.job_cart_status,
    c.client_email
FROM public.job_cart jc
JOIN public.client c ON jc.client_id = c.client_id
ORDER BY jc.created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Check quotation status
SELECT 
    q.quotation_id,
    q.quotation_price,
    q.quotation_status,
    sp.service_provider_name || ' ' || sp.service_provider_surname as provider
FROM public.quotation q
JOIN public.service_provider sp ON q.service_provider_id = sp.service_provider_id
ORDER BY q.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check payment records
SELECT 
    p.payment_id,
    p.payment_amount,
    p.payment_status,
    p.payment_date,
    c.client_email
FROM public.payment p
JOIN public.client c ON p.client_id = c.client_id
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Check booking records
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    b.booking_status,
    b.total_price,
    c.client_email,
    e.event_type
FROM public.booking b
JOIN public.client c ON b.client_id = c.client_id
JOIN public.event e ON b.event_id = e.event_id
ORDER BY b.created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue: No quotations showing up
**Check:**
- [ ] Job cart items exist for the client's event
- [ ] Quotations are linked to correct job_cart_id
- [ ] Quotation status is "pending"
- [ ] Your UI filters aren't hiding them

### Issue: Can't accept quotation
**Check:**
- [ ] User is logged in as the correct client
- [ ] Quotation belongs to user's event
- [ ] Accept button has correct event handler
- [ ] API endpoint is working

### Issue: Payment upload fails
**Check:**
- [ ] File upload configuration is correct
- [ ] Storage bucket permissions (if using Supabase Storage)
- [ ] File size limits
- [ ] File type restrictions

### Issue: Admin can't see payments
**Check:**
- [ ] Admin role/permissions are set correctly
- [ ] Payment records exist in database
- [ ] Admin query filters are correct
