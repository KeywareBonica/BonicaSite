## What Still Needs to Be Done

   - `markAsReceived(bookingId)` - Mark payment as received
   - `showFullImage(url)` - Show image in modal
   - `updateStatistics(bookings)` - Update stat cards
   - Payment status editing functionality

### 2. Integration with Supabase
   - Connect to payment and booking tables
   - Fetch payment data with booking details
   - Update payment status in database
   - Handle proof of payment display

### 3. Sidebar Navigation
   - Update the payments link in sidebar (line ~63)
   - Change from `admin-verify-payments.html` to `#payments`

### 4. Power BI Styling (Already Completed)
   - Reports section already has matching gradient colors
