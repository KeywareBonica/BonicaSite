# üí≥ Payment System Implementation Guide

## üìã Overview
This guide walks you through implementing the complete payment proof upload and verification system for Bonica Event Management.

---

## üéØ System Architecture

### **Components Created**
1. ‚úÖ **Database Layer** (`create_payment_system.sql`)
   - `payment` table with full audit trail
   - `payment_status_history` table for tracking changes
   - RPC functions for submit, verify, reject operations
   - Triggers for auto-logging

2. ‚úÖ **Storage Layer** (`create_payment_storage_bucket.sql`)
   - Secure storage bucket for payment proofs
   - Row-level security policies

3. ‚úÖ **Client Interface** (`client-upload-payment.html`)
   - Payment proof upload page
   - Booking selection
   - File drag & drop support

4. ‚úÖ **Admin Interface** (`admin-verify-payments.html`)
   - Payment verification dashboard
   - Approve/Reject functionality
   - Payment statistics

---

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Implementation

### **STEP 1: Run Database Migration**

1. Open Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `create_payment_system.sql`
3. Click "Run"
4. Verify completion:
   ```sql
   -- Check if tables were created
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
   WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
   AND table_name IN ('payment', 'payment_status_history');
   
   -- Check if RPC functions exist
   SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines 
   WHERE routine_schema = 'public' 
   AND routine_name IN ('submit_payment', 'verify_payment', 'reject_payment');
   ```

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ `payment` table created
- ‚úÖ `payment_status_history` table created
- ‚úÖ 5 RPC functions created
- ‚úÖ Triggers and indexes added

---

### **STEP 2: Create Storage Bucket**

#### **Option A: Via Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)**

1. Go to **Storage** ‚Üí **New Bucket**
2. Configure:
   - **Name:** `payment-proofs`
   - **Public:** OFF (Private)
   - **File size limit:** 5 MB
   - **Allowed MIME types:** `image/jpeg`, `image/jpg`, `image/png`, `application/pdf`
3. Click **Create bucket**

#### **Option B: Via SQL**
```sql
-- Run the contents of create_payment_storage_bucket.sql
```

#### **Set up Storage Policies**

Go to **Storage** ‚Üí `payment-proofs` ‚Üí **Policies** ‚Üí **New Policy**

**Policy 1: Clients can upload**
```sql
-- Policy name: "Clients can upload payment proofs"
-- Operation: INSERT
-- Policy definition:
bucket_id = 'payment-proofs'
```

**Policy 2: Everyone can view** (for now - can be restricted later)
```sql
-- Policy name: "Authenticated users can view"
-- Operation: SELECT
-- Policy definition:
bucket_id = 'payment-proofs'
```

---

### **STEP 3: Deploy Frontend Pages**

1. **Upload Client Page:**
   - Upload `client-upload-payment.html` to your web server
   - Add link to client dashboard navigation

2. **Upload Admin Page:**
   - Upload `admin-verify-payments.html` to your web server
   - Add link to service provider (admin) dashboard navigation

3. **Update Navigation Links:**

   **In `client-dashboard.html`:** Add payment upload link
   ```html
   <li><a href="client-upload-payment.html">
       <i class="fas fa-upload me-1"></i>Upload Payment
   </a></li>
   ```

   **In `service-provider-dashboard.html`:** Add payment verification link
   ```html
   <li><a href="admin-verify-payments.html">
       <i class="fas fa-money-check-alt me-1"></i>Verify Payments
   </a></li>
   ```

## üîÑ Complete Workflow

### **Client Side: Upload Payment**

1. **Client logs in** ‚Üí Goes to "Upload Payment" page
2. **Selects booking** requiring payment
3. **Views bank details** with payment reference
4. **Makes bank transfer** using provided details
5. **Uploads proof** (screenshot/PDF)
6. **System creates payment record** with status `pending`
7. **Booking status updates** to `payment_submitted`
8. **Client receives confirmation** message

### **Admin Side: Verify Payment**

1. **Admin logs in** ‚Üí Goes to "Verify Payments"
2. **Views pending payments** with statistics
3. **Reviews proof of payment** (can view full image/download)
4. **Verifies payment details** match bank transfer
5. **Takes action:**
   - **‚úÖ Verify:** Booking status ‚Üí `confirmed`, Payment status ‚Üí `verified`
   - **‚ùå Reject:** Booking status ‚Üí `pending_payment`, Payment status ‚Üí `rejected`
6. **Client receives notification** of decision

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Issue: "Payment table not found"**
**Solution:** Run `create_payment_system.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor

### **Issue: "RPC function not found"**
**Solution:** Check if functions exist:
```sql
SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_schema = 'public';
```

### **Issue: "Storage bucket doesn't exist"**
**Solution:** Create bucket manually in Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage

### **Issue: "File upload permission denied"**
**Solution:** Check storage policies are set up correctly

### **Issue: "Booking not showing in dropdown"**
**Solution:** Verify booking has:
- `client_id` matches logged-in user
- `payment_status` is 'unpaid' or 'pending_verification'
- `booking_status` is 'confirmed', 'active', or 'pending_payment'

### **Issue: "Admin can't verify payment"**
**Solution:** Ensure admin is logged in as service provider (check `localStorage.getItem('serviceProviderId')`)

## üìû Support

### **Database Queries**
```sql
-- Get all pending payments
SELECT * FROM payment WHERE payment_status = 'pending';

-- Get payment history for a booking
SELECT * FROM payment_status_history 
WHERE payment_id IN (SELECT payment_id FROM payment WHERE booking_id = 'YOUR_BOOKING_ID');

SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(payment_amount) 
FROM payment 
WHERE payment_status = 'verified' 
AND DATE(verification_date) = CURRENT_DATE;
```

### **Common Modifications**

**Change file size limit:**
```sql
-- Update in storage bucket settings or
UPDATE storage.buckets 
SET file_size_limit = 10485760 -- 10MB
WHERE id = 'payment-proofs';
```

**Add new payment method:**
```sql
-- Update constraint
ALTER TABLE payment DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS payment_payment_method_check;
ALTER TABLE payment ADD CONSTRAINT payment_payment_method_check 
CHECK (payment_method IN ('bank_transfer', 'eft', 'cash', 'card', 'payfast', 'other'));
```
